<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2>What is Curlmate?</h2>
<p>Curlmate is a persistent authentication layer for remote MCP servers. It securely stores refresh tokens and automatically issues fresh access tokens via API so your integrations don’t break when tokens expire.</p>

<h2>Who is this for?</h2>
<p>Developers running OAuth-backed remote MCP servers, especially those integrating with Claude Desktop.</p>

<h2>What problem does it solve?</h2>
<p>Access tokens expire. Refresh logic fails. OAuth callbacks are painful. When integrations break mid-flow, users often churn instead of debugging. Curlmate handles token refresh and auth reliability so your MCP servers stay connected.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>You authorize a third-party service once via OAuth. Curlmate securely stores the refresh token. When your MCP server needs access, it calls the Curlmate API and receives a fresh access token.</p>

<h2>Do I still need to implement OAuth?</h2>
<p>No. Curlmate handles the OAuth flow and token refresh. Your MCP server only needs to request fresh access tokens via API.</p>

<h2>What happens when access tokens expire?</h2>
<p>Curlmate automatically uses the stored refresh token to obtain a new access token before returning it to your server.</p>

<h2>What about refresh token rotation or scope changes?</h2>
<p>Curlmate handles refresh token updates and stores new tokens when providers rotate them. If scopes change or authorization is revoked, you will need to re-authorize.</p>

<h2>Is this secure?</h2>
<p>Refresh tokens are stored securely with encryption and access controls. API access requires a valid API key and connection identifier.</p>

<h2>Can I use this outside of Claude Desktop?</h2>
<p>Yes. Curlmate works with any backend or remote MCP server that needs reliable OAuth token refresh via API.</p>

<h2>What services are supported?</h2>
<p>Support depends on configured OAuth providers. Early access currently focuses on commonly used API services for MCP integrations.</p>

<h2>Is this production-ready?</h2>
<p>Curlmate is in early access and focused on providing reliable token refresh for real-world MCP deployments. Remote MCP integrations are live and used as proof of reliability.</p>

<h2>How do I get started?</h2>
<p>Request an API key, authorize your connection once, and use the token endpoint in your MCP server to retrieve fresh access tokens.</p>

<h2>What happens if I revoke access from the provider?</h2>
<p>If you revoke Curlmate’s OAuth access from the third-party provider, token refresh will stop and you will need to re-authorize.</p>

<h2>Does Curlmate call third-party APIs directly?</h2>
<p>No. Curlmate only manages OAuth tokens. Your MCP server calls the third-party API using the access token provided.</p>
