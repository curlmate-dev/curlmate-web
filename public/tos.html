  <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 8, 2026</p>

  <h2>1. The Service</h2>
  <p>Curlmate provides an authentication and token management service that allows third-party tools and remote MCP servers to access external APIs on your behalf.</p>
  <p>Curlmate does not operate or control third-party services and is not responsible for their availability or behavior.</p>

  <h2>2. Authorization & Tokens</h2>
  <p>By using Curlmate, you authorize us to initiate OAuth flows, receive and store access tokens and refresh tokens, and automatically refresh access tokens when they expire.</p>
  <p>Tokens are used only to perform actions explicitly requested by you or your connected tools.</p>
  <p>You may revoke access at any time through the relevant third-party service.</p>

  <h2>3. API Keys & Access</h2>
  <p>You are responsible for activity performed using your API keys. Keep your API keys secure.</p>
  <p>Curlmate may issue short-lived or temporary API keys and may suspend or revoke keys in cases of abuse or excessive usage.</p>

  <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>You may not use the Service for unlawful purposes, abuse rate limits, bypass security controls, or violate third-party service terms.</p>

  <h2>5. Service Availability</h2>
  <p>The Service is provided on an as-is and as-available basis. We do not guarantee uninterrupted access or successful token refreshes.</p>

  <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>Curlmate is not liable for service interruptions, token expirations, revoked access, or unauthorized use caused by compromised API keys.</p>
  <p>Total liability is limited to the amount paid by you for the Service in the previous 12 months.</p>

  <h2>7. Termination</h2>
  <p>You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate access if these Terms are violated or if continued operation poses security or legal risk.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions about these Terms, contact: <a href="mailto:support@curlmate.dev">support@curlmate.dev</a></p>
